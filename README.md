TypeScript project seed
=======================

This is a TypeScript project structure that has set up a
basic general structure and tooling for TypeScript-based projects.

The package includes:
* Convenient directory structure to organize your project files.
* Supporting languages: TypeScript, SASS, and Jade (Pug).
* Set up for unit testing TypeScript files using Karma and Jasmine.
* Code coverage generation for TypeScript source files.
* Linters to check for syntax errors on TypeScript and SASS files.
* Build scripts in NPM to compile, test, and distribute your project.

## How to use

Just use it as a starting point for your project. You can either
download an archived file of the structure or clone it using GIT.
If you choose the latter, just make sure to remove the .git folder before
you try to initialize your own GIT repository from it.

## Licensing

You can read the `LICENSE` file for this.
